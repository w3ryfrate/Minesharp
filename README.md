# Minesharp

Minesharp is a small scale clone of the popular sandbox videogame "Minecraft", owned by Microsoft Corporation. 

This project was made on Monogame, an open source implementation of the Microsoft Xna framework, basically a framework in C# to create games.

Currently the game is buggy and lags frequently, although I plan to optimise it in following updates. I may make it playable or not, depends on what I feel like.

## To run it:
- bin/Debug/net6.0-windows/Minesharp.exe

## Credits:

- Dirt texture by Microsoft Corporation
